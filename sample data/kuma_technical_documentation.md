## Executive Summary

Kuma is a modern, universal service mesh built on top of Envoy proxy that provides comprehensive L4-L7 connectivity, security, observability, and traffic management for microservices across Kubernetes and VM environments.

As a CNCF Sandbox project, Kuma offers enterprise-grade capabilities including multi-zone deployment, multi-mesh support, automatic mTLS, and advanced traffic routing with zero application code changes required.

## Architecture Overview

Kuma implements a distributed control plane architecture with clear separation between control and data planes:

• Control Plane (kuma-cp): Manages configuration, policies, and service discovery

• Data Plane (kuma-dp): Envoy-based proxies handling actual traffic routing

• Universal Design: Supports both Kubernetes and VM/bare-metal deployments

• Multi-mesh Architecture: Single control plane managing multiple isolated meshes

### Core Components

- kuma-cp: Control plane executable managing mesh configuration
- kuma-dp: Data plane proxy (Envoy) handling service traffic
- kumactl: Command-line interface for mesh management
- Envoy xDS APIs: Dynamic configuration distribution protocol

### Deployment Modes

- Kubernetes Mode: Uses K8s API server as data store with CRDs
- Universal Mode: PostgreSQL backend for non-Kubernetes environments
- Hybrid Mode: Mixed K8s and VM deployments in same mesh

## Multi-Zone Deployment

Kuma's multi-zone capability enables distributed service mesh across regions, clouds, and datacenters:

• Global Control Plane: Coordinates policies and service discovery across zones

• Zone Control Planes: Manage local data plane proxies and configurations

• Zone Ingress: Entry points for cross-zone traffic routing

• Zone Egress: Optional outbound traffic management for external services

### Multi-Zone Architecture Benefits

- Automatic service failover across zones
- Unified policy management across distributed infrastructure
- Cross-zone service discovery and load balancing
- Network isolation with secure inter-zone communication

### Failure Handling

- Global CP offline: Local operations continue, policy updates blocked
- Zone CP offline: Existing traffic flows, new services blocked
- Inter-zone connectivity issues: Local zone operations unaffected

## Security Features

Kuma provides comprehensive security through automatic mTLS and fine-grained access controls:

### Mutual TLS (mTLS)

- Automatic certificate generation and rotation
- SPIFFE-compatible service identities
- Built-in and custom CA backend support
- Certificate SAN format: spiffe://<mesh>/<service>

### Traffic Permissions

- Zero-trust security model by default
- Service-to-service authorization policies
- Tag-based access control rules
- Integration with external identity providers

## Traffic Management

Advanced traffic routing and load balancing capabilities for deployment strategies:

### Routing Policies

- MeshHTTPRoute: L7 HTTP traffic routing with headers, path matching
- MeshTCPRoute: L4 TCP traffic routing and load balancing
- Traffic Route: Legacy weighted routing for blue/green deployments
- Virtual Outbounds: Custom DNS names and ports for services

### Load Balancing

- Round-robin, least-request, and random algorithms
- Locality-aware load balancing for zone preference
- Health check integration for endpoint selection
- Weighted routing based on service instance counts

## Observability Stack

Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing capabilities:

### Metrics Collection

### Multi-Zone Setup

- Global control plane with TLS certificates
- Zone control plane KDS connectivity
- Zone ingress/egress proxy deployment
- Cross-zone policy synchronization

## Policy Configuration Examples

Practical examples of common mesh policies:

### mTLS Configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: Mesh
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  mtls:
    enabledBackend: ca-1
    backends:
    - name: ca-1
      type: builtin
      dpCert:
        rotation:
          expiration: 1d
      conf:
        caCert:
          RSAbits: 2048
          expiration: 10y
```

### Traffic Route Policy

```yaml
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: TrafficRoute
mesh: default
metadata:
  name: web-to-backend
spec:
  sources:
  - match:
      kuma.io/service: web
  destinations:
  - match:
      kuma.io/service: backend
  conf:
    split:
    - weight: 90
      destination:
        kuma.io/service: backend
        version: v1
    - weight: 10
      destination:
        kuma.io/service: backend
        version: v2
```

### Traffic Permission

```yaml
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: MeshTrafficPermission
metadata:
  name: web-to-backend
  labels:
    kuma.io/mesh: default
spec:
  targetRef:
    kind: MeshService
    name: backend
  from:
  - targetRef:
      kind: MeshService
      name: web
    default:
      action: Allow
```

## Best Practices

Production deployment recommendations for optimal performance and security:

### Security Best Practices

- Enable mTLS before deploying production workloads
- Configure MeshTrafficPermission policies for zero-trust
- Use custom CA certificates for production environments
- Implement proper RBAC for control plane access

### Performance Optimization

- Configure reachable services to limit proxy configuration size
- Use locality-aware load balancing for cross-zone traffic
- Implement proper resource limits for sidecar containers
- Monitor and tune Envoy proxy memory usage

### Operational Excellence

- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Set up distributed tracing for request flow visibility
- Configure proper backup and disaster recovery
- Establish proper certificate rotation procedures

## Migration Strategies

Approaches for adopting Kuma in existing environments:

### Gradual Adoption

- Start with non-critical services for initial testing
- Use permissive mTLS mode during migration phase
- Implement canary deployments for gradual rollout
- Monitor traffic patterns before policy enforcement

### Legacy Integration

- Configure external services for non-mesh endpoints
- Use gateway mode for existing API gateway integration
- Implement traffic splitting between mesh and non-mesh services
- Plan for database and external dependency connectivity
